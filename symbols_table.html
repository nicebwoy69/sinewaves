<h3>Additional Notes</h3>

1. **Angular Frequency (\( \omega = 2 \pi f \))**: Angular frequency represents how rapidly the phase angle changes per second. It’s critical for understanding how quickly a wave oscillates and is especially useful in phase and delay calculations.

2. **Phase (\( \phi \))**: Phase can have multiple meanings in audio analysis. As an initial phase, it represents the wave’s starting point. For phase delay between two signals, it quantifies how much one signal lags behind another. 

3. **Time Delay (\( t_D \))**: Time delay can be derived from phase delay, as shown by \( t_D = \frac{\phi}{-2 \pi f} \), useful when assessing phase alignment in signal interference.

4. **Window Functions (Hann, Hamming, Blackman)**: These functions are applied in FFT/DFT to handle edge effects and spectral leakage, which can distort the frequency representation in digital signals. Each function has specific benefits based on signal characteristics:
   - **Hann Window**: Best for continuous, smoother signals.
   - **Hamming Window**: Reduces leakage for discrete signals with sharp transitions.
   - **Blackman Window**: Offers high-resolution frequency response, useful for precise audio processing.

5. **FM Synthesis Parameters**: Frequency Modulation (FM) synthesis relies on a carrier wave modulated by a secondary frequency, creating complex tones rich in harmonics. The modulation index \( I \) controls the extent of frequency deviation, crucial for generating intricate sound textures.
