 Auditory localisation
 • Human auditory localisation relies on 
‘three’ main cues:
 • Interaural Time Difference (ITD)
 • Interaural Level Difference (ILD)
 • Pinnae Cue: Head Related Transfer Function 
(HRTF)

Interaural Time Difference (ITD)
 • As the source angle increases from 0 to 90°, the ITD 
increases almost linearly from 0 to 0.68ms.

ITD and IPD
 • The human localisation mechanism uses the interaural 
phase difference (IPD) caused by ITD to localise the 
source position.

Phase ambiguity problem for IPD
 • At frequencies above approximately 735Hz (where the 
period is twice the max ITD), IPD cues become 
ambiguous.

Phase ambiguity problem
 • Above approximately 1.5kHz, IPD (or ITD) cues have no 
effect on localisation. (our brain cannot resolve a fine 
difference in phase.)

Binaural beats
 • If two tones with slightly different frequencies below 
about 735Hz are presented at each ear, one can 
perceive a sensation of ‘beats’.
 • This effect disappears at higher frequencies because in 
binaural hearing the ear is not able to process the 
alternating phase difference between the two 
frequencies.
 • Monaural beats can be observed over the whole audible 
frequency range!

 Interaural Level Difference (ILD)
 • At low frequencies, 
wavelengths are longer than 
the diameter of a head.
 • The air pressure variation is 
detected by two ears at a 
very similar level.
 àThere is no meaningful ILD.

 Interaural Level Difference (ILD)
 • At frequencies above 
approximately 630Hz (where 
the wavelength is shorter than 
three times the head 
diameter), a ‘head shadow’ 
effect occurs.
 àILD cues become useful.

Duplex theory
 • In summary, auditory localisation of ‘pure tones’ relies on 
ITD cues at low frequencies and ILD cues at high 
frequencies. (Proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1907.)

Challenges to the duplex theory
 • Note that the duplex theory is only applied for pure 
tones!  
• For complex sound sources (e.g. musical instruments) 
ITD can be detected at higher frequencies. 
(The localisation mechanism makes use of the low 
frequency ‘envelope’ of high frequencies to detect ITDs.)

Minimum audible angle (MAA)
 • Resolution of audible angular difference decreases as 
the source position moves from the front to the side.
 
 
The cone of confusion
 • The ITD and ILD model alone cannot explain front-back 
or vertical localisation.– Without pinna, multiple locations would produce identical ITD 
and ILD (Cone of confusion).– The duplex theory is valid only for horizontal -90°to 90° . 
A

 C
 B
 A and B produce similar ILD and ITD.
 C and D produce similar ILD and ITD.
 
 
Pinna effects
 • The complex shape of pinna provides different frequency 
responses (spectra) for sounds coming from different 
directions in three dimensions.
 àThis enables us to resolve front-back and vertical directions 
even with just one ear.

Head Related Transfer Function
 • The frequency response of ear input signal filtered by 
pinna is called ‘HRTF’ (Head Related Transfer Function).– The HRTFs for left and right ears differ from each other for a 
given source angle, .– The characteristics of HRTFs become most dominant at above 
5kHz (Peaks and dips)

 Fig. 11. The ear-input spectra of a phantom center source from
 the 90 loudspeaker base angle for four different subjects, taken
 subjects taken from the SADIE HRIR database
 individual differences observed at frequencies above 3 kHz
 indicate that the effect of pinnae-related cue on the phan
tomimageelevation effect might be subject-dependent. For
 example, the spectrum for the subject 003 appears to have
 aminimalmagnitudedifferencebetween4kHzand8kHz
 compared to the other subjects. This seems to suggest that
 for this subject the directional band weighting claimed by
 Blauert would not be an effective cue for the elevation ef
fect. In addition, the subjective result showing the response
 spread across “above front,” “above,” and “above back”
 might also be associated with the inter-subject variability
 in pinnae-related spectrum.
 On the other hand, the crosstalk-related notch frequen
cies in the low frequency region appear to be relatively
 consistent across all of the four subjects in Fig. 11. This
Measuring HRTF
 • A HRTF is the frequency 
domain transform of a time 
domain ‘Head Related Impulse 
Response’ (HRIR).– HRIR à FFT à HRTF– The most common method is to 
measure HRIRs for different 
directions in an anechoic chamber.– Personal HRIRs using in-ear 
microphones.– General HRIRs using a dummy 
head with a torso simulator.
 22
 
 
Head Related Transfer Function
 • HRTFs are highly individual like the finger print.
 
 
 23
 
 Head Related Transfer Function
 • Individual HRTFs can be measured using a miniature 
microphone inserted in the ear canal. 
• A very time consuming process to measure all directions 
with a high angular resolution.

 but only one had experience in localisation in VADs. These will be referred to as follows, HL 
(participant with the most experience in this type of test), DJ and MM (participants with little 
experience in this type of test but with a great deal of listening test experience). 
Ear Impressions 
acquiring the HRTF measurements, 
individualised ear impressions were made of each test 
participant’s left and right ears. In order to acquire 
these measurements, participants were first required to 
otoscopy by a hearing professional to 
ensure that no obtrusions such as cerumen were 
blocking the pathway to the tympanic membrane. 
then created by a professional 
audiologist. These were made out of polyvinyl

subject DJ before microphone insertion. 
Head Related Transfer Function
 • Individual HRTF could be 
modelled based on the person’s 
anthropometric data.
 • The HRTF depends on the size 
and shape of the pinnae, ear to 
neck distance, etc.
 • Identify which parts of the ear 
and torso cause peaks and 
notches at specific frequencies.
