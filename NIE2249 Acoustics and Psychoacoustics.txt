Module overview
 • What is Psychoacoustics? – Science about how humans perceive various types of sound.– Aims to define physical parameters that are associated with 
auditory perception.
 àPsychoacoustics is a branch of Psychophysics.– Application areas
 • Audio coding (MP3, AAC, MPEG-H, etc.)
 • Spatial audio (recording and mixing techniques, speaker format etc.)
 • Hearing aid

Module overview
 • Knowledge and Understanding of– The generation and propagation of sound – The mechanisms of human auditory perception– The objective parameters for small room and concert hall
 • Abilities to– Capture acoustic signals in a small room and a concert hall using 
appropriate equipment– Analyse and process acoustic signals using MATLAB– Write a technical report from the capture, analysis and processing.

What is Sound?

Definition of sound
 • “Sound is vibration transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas;
 particularly, sound means those vibrations composed of frequencies
 capable of being detected by ears” [Wikipedia]
 àVibration itself is not sound. Sound is generated by vibration!
 • “Sensation caused in the ear by the vibration of the surrounding air or
 other medium” [Oxford English Dictionary]
 àSensation itself is not sound. Auditory Sensation is caused by sound!
 • “Mechanical radiant energy that is transmitted by longitudinal
 pressure waves in a material medium (as air) and is the objective
 cause of hearing” [Merriam-Webster Dictionary]

Definition of sound
 “Mechanical radiant energy that is generated by
 vibration and transmitted by longitudinal pressure waves
 in a material medium (as air) and is the objective cause of
 hearing”

Sound wave
 • Sound is a longitudinal wave. 
A vibrating source causes a series of compression and 
rarefaction of the air particles and the resulting wave propagates 
longitudinally.

Sound wave
 • Spherical wave– Emanates from a point source.– Sound is radiated towards all direction spherically.– Most sound sources are not completely point sources (e.g. human 
voice and musical instruments are more directional at high 
frequencies).

Sound wave
 • Plane wave– A special case of sound wave.– The source of wave is a straight line or flat surface rather than a 
point (e.g. flat panel speaker).– The wave propagates unidirectionally.

Sound wave
 • Plane wave– Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) technology can synthesise a plane 
wave using multiple point sources within a loudspeaker array.

Sound wave
 • Sound is a pressure wave. 
The degree of particle displacement represents the degree of 
pressure variation.  à determines the perceived loudness.

Sound wave
 • Sound is a pressure wave. 
The degree of particle displacement represents the degree of 
pressure variation.  à determines the perceived loudness.
 • Particle displacement: 0.5nm ~ 5mm
 • Pressure variation: 20 μPa ~ 100Pa

 Rarefaction
 • Period (T)
 Cycle
 time
 Time to complete one cycle in second (s)
 • Wavelength  
(Lambda λ)
 Length of one complete cycle in metre (m)
 Amplitude
 • Amplitude (A) Maximum particle displacement from rest position 
(Pa or N/m2) 
• Frequency (f) Number of cycle per second (Hz)

Properties of a sound wave
 • Speed of sound (c) in air– Dependent on temperature.– Becomes faster in higher temperatures.
 ( 0˚C : 332m/s, 20˚C: 344m/s )– We will use 340m/s as the standard speed of sound.
 • Speeds of sound for different materials

Properties of a sound wave
 • Speed of sound = Wavelength (metre) x Frequency (Hz)
 ! = #×%
 • What is the range of wavelength in air that human ears can 
detect?
 Audible hearing range = 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz
 # =!/%
 340/20 = 17m 
340/20,000 = 0.017m = 17mm

Properties of a sound wave
 • What’s the frequency of sound with a wavelength of
 34cm in the air?
 ! =#/% =340/0.34 = 1000Hz
 • Howfar does the sound travel in the air for 1ms?
 1s : 340m = 0.001s : X
 X =340x0.001 = 0.34m = 34cm
