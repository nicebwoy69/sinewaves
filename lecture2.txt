sound pressure.– Calculate sound power level (SWL), sound intensity level (SIL) and 
sound pressure level (SPL).– Calculate SPL for multiple sound sources.

Sound energy radiation
 • Point source à sound energy is radiated omni-directionally 
(Directionality index Q = 1). 
• The energy is distributed over an increasingly large area as 
the sound wave propagates further from the source.

Sound energy radiation
 • Standard acoustic measurement techniques (e.g. ISO3382) 
are based on the assumption that the sound source is a 
point source.
 • In practice, a perfect point source is difficult to find.
 • Dodecahedron loudspeaker is a practical alternative to a 
perfect point source.

Sound power
 • The energy of sound radiated by a sound source in all 
directions per unit of time– A property of the sound source itself.– Independent of the measurement distance or environment.– Measurement unit: watts (W)

Sound pressure
 • The root mean square (RMS) pressure of a sound measured 
at a specific point in space (e.g. ear, microphone). – Measurement unit: Pascal (Pa)– Minimum audible pressure: 20uPa (micro pascal)– Threshold of pain: 20Pa or higher

Measuring sound levels
 • Sound power, intensity and pressure are physical 
quantities of sound.
 • Sound “level” is measured in the ratio of a physical quantity 
relative to a specified reference level.
 • Reference level represents the lower threshold of audibility.

Measuring sound levels
 • The ratio is expressed on a logarithmic scale because of 
the way we perceive the loudness of a sound.

Sound Intensity Level (SIL)
 • The Inverse Square Law– The sound intensity per each unit area decreases in proportion to 
the inverse square of the distance from the source.– This is because as the sound propagates its energy spreads over 
the surface area of a sphere.

Sound Intensity Level (SIL)
 • The Inverse Square Law– Every time the distance from the source is doubled, the sound 
intensity decreases by a factor of 4.– e.g. If the sound intensity at 2m distance was 0.1 W/m2, the 
intensity at 4m would be 0.1 x ¼ = 0.025 W/m2.

Sound Pressure Level (SPL)
 • A logarithmic measure of the sound pressure in 
comparison to the minimum audible pressure (20uPa). – Related to the perceived loudness of sound since human ears are 
sensitive to pressure.

Relationship among sound levels
 • Rules of Thumb (for a point source)
 1. For a given sound power, SPL and SIL measured at the same 
distance essentially have the same value. 
SIL =SWL−10log10 
4πr2
 (
 ) =SPL
 SIL
 2. For a given sound power, SIL or SPL measured at 1m is always 
11dB lower than SWL.
 SIL or SPL @ 1m = SWL – 11dB
 3. Whenever the measurement distance is doubled, there is 6dB 
reduction in SIL or SPL.
 SIL or SPL @ 2m = SWL – 17dB
 
 22
 
Relationship among sound levels
 • Example: A point source has SWL of 120 dB.– What is SIL at 1m?– What is SPL at 2m?
 Power 1W

Addition of sounds
 • Correlated sources– Identical sources (e.g. 
Loudspeakers radiating the 
same signal)
 • Uncorrelated sources– Different sources (e.g. 
Multiple singers)
 24
 
 
Addition of sounds
 • Total SPL for N “correlated” sources?
 • First, we need to know the total pressure.– Simply add the pressures of all sources.
