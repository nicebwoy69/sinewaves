Lecture 3 key points
• After this lecture, you should be able to
– Explain what phase and magnitude of a sinusoid are.
– Apply phase delay to a sinusoidal function.
– Explain the difference between the addition of
correlated sinusoids and that of uncorrelated
sinusoids.

Sinusoidal signals
• Sinusoid is the simplest form of audio signal having a
single frequency (i.e. a tone).

Sinusoidal signals
• Sinusoid is the simplest form of audio signal having a
single frequency, referring to both sine and cosine waves.

Sinusoidal signals
• Fourier transform analyses the individual sinusoid
components (amplitude and phase) that compose a
complex sound.

At a given time, different frequencies
have different phases.

Phase
• Phase is a certain point of time in one period of a
sinusoidal function (each frequency), expressed in angle.
• In audio signal processing we use radian angle rather than
degree to express phase.
• Conversion between degree and radian

π
Degree 0° 45° 90° 180° 360°
