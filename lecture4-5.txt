Human ear
 • Outer ear– Modifies the frequency response 
of incoming sound.– Pinna provides cues for sound 
localisation.
 • Middle ear– Transmits acoustic (mechanical) 
vibrations to the inner ear 
without loss of energy.– Match low-impedance air wave 
(outer ear) to high-impedance 
membrane wave (inner ear).– Protects the hearing system by 
increasing the impedance for 
sudden loud sounds ( > 75dB 
SPL)

Human ear
 • Inner ear (Cochlea)– Converts mechanical vibrations 
into nerve firings so that they 
can be interpreted by the brain. – Analyses the frequency 
components of input sounds.

Basilar membrane (BM)
 • Part of the cochlea that is responsible for analysing the 
frequencies of ear input signal.
 • Vibrates in response to stimulation by signals in the 
audible frequency range (20Hz – 20kHz).

Basilar membrane (BM)
 • Different frequencies 
cause maximum 
variations at different 
places along the basilar 
membrane.- At lower frequencies the BM 
vibrates as a whole with a 
maximum vibrating position at 
places near the apex.- At higher frequencies a 
maximum vibration occurs at 
places near the base with a 
sharper envelope.

Basilar membrane (BM)
 • The range of frequencies 
covered by a unit BM 
region increases 
logarithmically from Apex 
to Base.
 The frequency resolution of 
the human ear decreases 
as the frequency goes up.

Basilar membrane (BM)
 • For complex sounds with 
many frequencies, the 
overall BM response is 
the sum of  the responses 
for the individual 
frequencies.
 • Each region on the BM 
responds to a limited 
range of frequencies.
 àThe BM acts as an 
auditory filter bank.

Frequency resolution
 • Two pure tones with different frequencies simultaneously 
inputted to the ears cannot be completely resolved if the 
frequency difference is not large enough.
 àSensations of ‘beats’ and ‘roughness’ can be 
perceived.
 • It is possible to perceive fully separated frequencies only 
when the frequency difference exceeds the Critical 
Modulation Frequency (CMF).

of      
(Difference or beat frequency)– The variation of amplitude in time is slow enough to chase.

Critical bandwidth (CB)
 • If F1 is the centre frequency, the span of the lower and 
higher CMFs is called the ‘Critical Bandwidth (CB)’ for F1.
 • CMF is a ‘subjective’ measure of the CB.

Critical bandwidth (CB)
 • “Objective” measures for CB proposed based on 
subjective tests à Assumes that the BM movement is 
symmetrical.
 • The formula varies with different researchers.
 • CB by Zwicker (1954)

 • Equivalent Rectangular Band
 (ERB) by Moore and Grasberg (1983)

Equivalent Rectangular Band (ERB)
 • Can be created using the Gammatone Filterbank.
 • The number of bands can be chosen flexibly (e.g. 24 ~ 64).

Critical bandwidth vs. Frequency
 • As frequency goes up, the CB of the frequency 
increases.
 àa high frequency difference is more difficult to perceive than a low 
frequency difference.

Critical bandwidth vs. Frequency
 • As frequency goes up, the CB of the frequency 
increases.
 àThis is because the frequency resolution of higher frequencies is 
lower than that of lower frequencies. (There is a greater overlap 
between the BM movement envelopes at high frequencies.)

Frequency masking
 • When two sounds with similar frequencies are played 
simultaneously the louder sound (Masker) masks the 
weaker sound (Maskee), 
It depends on the “critical bandwidths” of the 
masker and maskee.

 • If two tones are widely separated in frequency (If the 
maskeefrequency is outside the critical bandwidth of the 
masker), there is no masking.

Masking Threshold & 
Signal to Mask Ratio (SMR)
 • Masking Threshold: the maximum level of maskee at 
which the masking effect occurs. (above the masking 
threshold, there is no more masking.)
 • SMR: the minimum level difference between masker and 
maskee at which the masking effect begins to occur.

Noise masking pure tone
 • As the bandwidth (BW) of a masker noise is increased 
with a constant power density with the CB of its centre 
frequency, the strength of masking effect is increased.
