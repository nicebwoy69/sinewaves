Phase
 • Phase is a certain point of time in one period of a 
sinusoidal function (each frequency), expressed in angle.
 • In audio signal processing we use radian angle rather than 
degree to express phase.
 • Conversion between degree and radian

Adding sinusoids together
 • Correlated sinusoids – Can differ in amplitude 
and phase, but must 
have the same frequency.– E.g. 100Hz sine waves 
with different amplitudes 
and phase shift
 30
 
 
Adding sinusoids together
 • Uncorrelated sinusoids – Must have different
 frequencies.– E.g. 100Hz, 200Hz and 
400Hz sine waves with 
the same amplitude
 31
 
 
Adding sinusoids together
 • Adding correlated sinusoids– When correlated signals 
having the same phase are 
added together, the resulting 
peak amplitude is the sum of 
the peak amplitudes of the 
individual signals.– E.g. 1 + 1 = 2
 32
 
 
Adding sinusoids together
 • Adding correlated sinusoids– When correlated signals with 
different phase offsets are 
added together, the resulting 
peak amplitude has non-linear 
relationship with the individual 
peak amplitudes. – E.g. 1 + 1 = 1.4– But the frequency of the added
 signal still remains the same!
 33
 
 
Adding sinusoids together
 • Adding correlated sinusoids– When correlated signals with 
different phase offsets are 
added together, the resulting 
peak amplitude has non linear 
relationship with the individual 
peak amplitudes. – If the phase difference 
between the two signals is           
(180°), then the summed 
signal has 0 amplitude.

Adding sinusoids together
 • Adding uncorrelated sinusoids– When uncorrelated sinusoids are 
added together, the resulting 
amplitude is always greater than 
the individual signals.– The resulting signal has a 
completely different waveform 
with harmonic or non-harmonic 
partials.– When harmonic sinusoids are 
added, you can hear both 
frequencies separately.

 • Adding uncorrelated sinusoids– When uncorrelated sinusoids are 
added together, the resulting 
amplitude is always greater than 
the individual signals.– The resulting signal has a 
completely different waveform 
with harmonic or non-harmonic 
partials.– When non-harmonic sinusoids 
are added, the resulting signal is 
modulated by the difference 
frequency (Amplitude Modulation) Modulated at 50Hz
 36
 (fm = 500Hz – 450Hz)

 37
 (fm = 500Hz – 490Hz)
 
 
Adding sinusoids together
 • Summary– When correlated sinusoid signals are added together, the resulting 
signal is another sine wave with the same frequency.– The summed amplitude of correlated sinusoids can be lower or 
higher than the individual amplitude depending on the phase 
difference between the two. – Summation of two correlated sinusoids with a phase difference of       
will cause the signals to cancel.– Summation of uncorrelated sinusoids produce a different signal.
 • Harmonic signals: all frequencies are heard separately. 
• Non-harmonic signals: modulated at the difference frequency.
