 Loudness Perception
 
 
Lecture 5-6 key points
 • After this lecture, you should be able to:– Explain what Equal Loudness Contour is.– Explain the difference between Phon and Sone.– Explain the effects of bandwidth and duration of sound on perceived 
loudness.

Loudness level
 • Perceived Loudness vs. Sound Level
 100Hz  
vs.
 4kHz 
• Sound level (e.g. SPL) is NOT a direct measure for perceived 
loudness.
 • Perceived loudness is a subjective quantity and depends on the 
frequency, bandwidth, amplitude and duration of sound.
 
 2
 
Loudness level
 • Audibility threshold– Human cannot perceive 
sounds at SPLs below the 
audibility threshold.– Varies with different 
frequencies. – Peaks and dips à due to 
the resonances of outer ear.– Human ears are most 
sensitive at around 3.4kHz.

Loudness level
 • Equal loudness contours– Obtained by adjusting the 
levels of different frequency 
tones to give a loudness 
match to the reference 1kHz 
tone at a given level.

Loudness level
 • Phon– Unit of ‘loudness level’– SPL measured at 1kHz– As the loudness level  
increases, the equal 
loudness contour becomes 
flatter.– Ear becomes more sensitive 
to extreme LF and HF at 
greater phons.

Frequency weighting
 • Frequency weighting – Applied for SPL metres to 
compensate for the variation 
of the ear’s sensitivity for 
different frequencies.
 • A-weighting (dBA)– Most commonly used.– Suitable for sounds with 
medium/low absolute levels, 
but can be used for any 
purpose.
 7
 
 
Frequency weighting
 • C-weighting (dBC)– More accurate for sounds 
with more low frequencies.
 e.g. Machinery noise
 • B-weighting (dBB)– Compromise between A and 
C weightings.
 • D-weighting (dBD)– Specifically used for 
measuring high aircraft noise.
 
 8
 
Perceived loudness
 • Sone– Unit of ‘perceived loudness’– A doubling of the number of 
sones corresponds to a 
doubling of the perceived 
loudness.
 Sones
 (

 = Phons
 e.g. 40 phons = 1 sone– Increasing phons by 10 (10 dB 
SPL increase at 1kHz)  leads 
to double loudness.

Perceived loudness
 • Just noticeable difference (JND) in amplitude– Perceived loudness resolution– Depends on the type of signal.– Broadband noise: 0.5 ~ 1dB for sound levels at 20 ~ 100dB(SPL)– 1kHz sinusoid: 3dB at 10dB(SPL), 0.3dB at 80dB(SPL)– In general, JND in amplitude is about 1dB.

Effect of bandwidth on loudness 
• For a fixed sound energy, perceived loudness remains constant 
for bandwidths less than the critical bandwidth for loudness 
(CBL)
 • Beyond CBL, loudness increases as the bandwidth becomes 
wider.

Effect of bandwidth on loudness 
• As the bandwidth of a sound increases, more critical bands (or 
auditory filters) are stimulated.
 àThis gives rise to a sensation of greater loudness.

Effect of bandwidth on loudness 
• However, at very low SPLs (10 ~ 20 dB SPL) perceived 
loudness is independent of bandwidth.

Effect of duration on loudness
 • At a given intensity loudness increases with duration for up to 
100~200ms.
 • Perception of full loudness takes time to build up.

Hearing impairments 
• Loss of sensitivity– Short term exposure to noise could cause a temporary shift in 
hearing threshold.– This can become permanent in case of long term or repeated 
exposure.

Loudness level
 • With long term exposure 
to loud noise, the absolute 
audibility threshold is 
shifted upwards and it 
takes some time for the 
original threshold to be 
fully recovered.

• Loss of frequency selectivity–The more exposed to excessive noise, the lower the sensitivity to 
different frequencies becomes.–The critical band becomes wider àMore difficult to distinguish 
between different frequencies.

infection, or earwax.

 Hearing impairments 
• “Normal hearing”ranges from 0 to 20 dB HL (Hearing 
Level) in all frequencies.

 What Is the Difference between dB IL and dB SPL?  
 As stated in the previous section, a common method to express the magnitude of 
a sound is in decibels sound pressure level or dB SPL, for which the reference is 
 . A less common method to express sound intensity is in acous
tic power by using decibels intensity level, or  dB IL . The reference for dB IL is 10 −16  
 . According to  Gulick, Gescheider, and Frisina (1989) , “a dangerously intense 
sound would represent a power of only about 0.0024 watt” (p. 46). As a result, it is 
cumbersome to measure the incredibly small amounts of power associated with 
olds across frequency in dB 
SPL, corresponding to 0 dB 
HL. For example, at 125 Hz: 
0 dB HL = 45 dB SPL, and at 
1000 Hz: 0 dB HL = 7 dB SPL.

Hearing impairments 
• Protecting ears – Long term and constant exposure to noises that have SPL greater 
than 90 dB(A) can cause permanent hearing damage.– European legislation 
• First action level: 80dB (A) – Employees can request hearing 
protection.
 • Second action level: 85dB(A) – Employers must provide 
employees with hearing protections.– Listen to music at lower levels.– Take a rest after a certain period of listening.– Use a hearing protector when exposed to loud sounds
